<p>It is becoming more and more evident that psychological triggers amount for the highest percentage of Cybersecurity risks than actual technical exploits.<br />
A paper on <em><a rel="attachment wp-att-298" href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/562005d9e4b053a5136bfb77/56200709e4b065725940b633/56200715e4b065725940b867/1444939541799/?format=original">Individual Differences in Cyber Security Behaviors: An Examination of Who Is Sharing Passwords</a> explains the psychology behind selecting a password and sharing passwords.</em></p>

<p>It will save you lots of headaches.</p>
