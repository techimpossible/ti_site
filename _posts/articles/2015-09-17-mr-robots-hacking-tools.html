<p>There is nothing more exciting than a TV Show that uses actual Security tools as these are used today in real life.<br />
I knew there was something different about this show, as soon as I read  <em>Anonymous Content </em>in the credits.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Robot is amazing.</strong></p>
<p>The best TV Shows are the ones where the plot and the scenario is built around real facts. There is a kernel of truth and that blurs the lines of reality and fiction like in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fringe_(TV_series)">Fringe</a>.</p>
<p>One of the tools that is being used in the show is a new encrypted email service called <a href="https://protonmail.ch/">Protonmail</a>.</p>
<p>It is based in Switzerland, outside of <strong>EU</strong> and <strong>US</strong> jurisdiction and the private encryption keys stay with the user.</p>
<p>I haven't felt this excited about an email service since Gmail came out in 2006 and was first signing up.</p>
<p>I've made a quick list of the other tools used so far in the TV Show as described in WIRED.</p>
