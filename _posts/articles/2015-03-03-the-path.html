<p>This is my very first blog post and my journey into designing my ideal lifestyle through visualisation, research and Continuous and never-ending improvement.<br />
I explore different aspects of my lifestyle that I now lead and the gap to where I want to be. I'll be sharing reviews, ideas, successes and failures of my journey.</p>
<p>If you haven't read the "<a href="http://georiot.co/3itD">4 Hour Work Week</a>" from Timothy Ferriss, I highly recommend it. It is a great book with lots of insight and it is one of your ways out of the Matrix.</p>
