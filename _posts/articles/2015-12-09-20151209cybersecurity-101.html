excerpt: Walking around The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park the other
  day as part of the MKBRF (Milton Keynes Business Resilience Forum), I realised how
  complacent we have become with the way our life is, that we won't bother with anything
  that looks like is going to be too much.Looking at the Colossus, while the tour
  guide explained what went on during those times and the thinking, logic and processes
  required to decipher messages, I was stunned. I was left thinking how much less
  involved we are these days and even then, we give up because it looks strange, new
  or confusing.We have to learn from our past, to be able to understand the future.

<p>Walking around The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park the other day as part of the <a href="http://www.mkbrf.org/">MKBRF</a> (Milton Keynes Business Resilience Forum), I realised how complacent we have become with the way our life is, that we won't bother with anything that looks like is going to be too much.</p>
<p>Looking at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_computer">Colossus</a>,&nbsp;while the tour guide explained what went on during those times and the thinking, logic and processes required to decipher messages, I was stunned. I was left thinking how much less involved we are these days and even then, we give up because it looks strange, new or confusing.</p>

<h2>Cyber Security Essentials</h2>
<p>Most of the breaches that have happened and will continue to happen, as not so much down to technology but human intervention. We lead ourselves to believe that the solution is complicated, where in essence,&nbsp;it is awareness and practical experience, whether that is us as Security Professionals or the company's workforce.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-risk-management-a-board-level-responsibility/10-steps-summary"><strong>10 Steps To Cyber Security</strong></a>&nbsp;that was put together by CESG, CPNI, Cabinet Office and DBIS covers the absolute essentials that you should be aware while working towards establishing controls and mitigation measures.</p>

<p>10 Steps To Cyber Security</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Security Controls For The Corporate World</h2>
<p> </p>
<h2>1. User Education and Awareness</h2>
<p>The more we move into the IoT and everything acquires a MAC address and an IP address, the further unavoidable breaches are going to be. However, as we have seen from numerous studies, more often than not, it isn't technology that fails to deliver, but people.</p>
<p>It is scary when thinking about a <em>rise of the machines</em> type of future where people are being terminated by the machines due to being error-prone, like a bad line of code. Before we get to that,&nbsp;we can and absolutely should educate our staff to adopt a security mindset before touching the mouse or that touchscreen that screams at them a million different ways.</p>
<p>There are numerous ways to do that, but it has to be hands on, not some email or internal comms that end up in the spam folder every week. There are armies of organised crime that go to work every morning like you do. Their job though is to get your staff to click on phishing email or download software that will allow them to break into your company. Why not train your people by actually spamming them yourself and get them to develop ninja skills when it comes to email validity?</p>
<p>You don't have to join the Chinese army to do that, but instead use one of the online services like KnowBe4. This will allow you to test current scams and prepare your company. The KnowBe4 service is something I have tried and have seen immediate value. Kevin Mitnick is their Chief Hacking Officer and is also the one delivering the training videos that you can use for all your obsessive clickers.</p>
<p>On a different level, I have been looking into a training course provided by SANS that teaches you <em><a href="https://www.sans.org/course/securing-human-build-maintain-measure-security-awareness-program">How to Build, Maintain and Measure a High-Impact Awareness Program</a>.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>2. Home and Mobile Working</h2>
<p>The emergence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_your_own_device">BYOD</a>&nbsp;has brought about a new layer of complexity. Technology is moving so fast and we are following along, without having mapped out what are the implications of adopting every aspect of this interconnected world. The fact that more and more companies make use of SaaS, make location irrelevant. The use of MDM is becoming fundamental without necessarily mitigating all inherent risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>3. Secure Configuration</h2>
<p>Although the world used to be dominated by Windows for the past few years, times are changing. We are faced with Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS, Android, Chrome OS and we are tasked with making sure that our policies stand true and there is a baseline security configuration. This is quite tricky but doable.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>4. Removable Media Controls</h2>
<p>Those USB flash drives were so amazing and interesting when they first appeared but have become more of a nightmare these days. I remember when my parents used to tell me not take anything from strangers especially candy.</p>
<p>It goes the same with USB sticks. Don't take one from strangers or pick up one you found on the street and go back home or even worst at your office desk and plug it in. USB sticks have evolved so much that you are install software and have it autorun without ever noticing.</p>
<p>Having a removable media scanning and encryption system is very important, because people will still plug in thingies.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>5. Managing User Privileges</h2>
<p>Not all users are created equal. At least in the Active Directory realm. You don't want your users to have local administrator rights or even worst domain administrator rights. This isn't to be authoritative and oppressive but more to protect your network from exploits that will install while users are blissfully unaware.</p>
<p>The higher up the chain the lesser access rights should be assigned. The fact that the latest malware will happily execute commands without being detected and without requiring escalation is an indicative that that removing unnecessary rights is part of the basics.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>6. Incident Management</h2>
<p>It goes without saying that you can't manage what you can't measure. Having an Incident Management process in place specifically for Cyber Security is highly recommended. This is also referred to as CIRT. Depending on your setup, you need various departments involved when a Cyber Security Incident unfolds. A great FREE tool I've been using for capturing Cyber Security incidents and managing them is <a href="https://www.cybercpr.com/">Cyber CPR</a>&nbsp;from Logically Secure. Something I have only heard from Steve Armstrong so far at 44CON, who is the CEO of Logically Secure, is the concept of a hostile environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the moment that your network has been breached, you are operating within a hostile environment. Why would you continue to do your comms and coordination still using the compromised environment. Thus, having a separate network for managing such incidents is very important.</p>
<p>On the operational side of things, I have found this <a href="/s/AlienVault-Incident-Response-Guide.pdf">guide</a> from AlienVault, which details how to set up your own Cyber Incident Response Team.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>7. Monitoring</h2>
<p>Going a step further from the conventional monitoring and analysis solutions, currently marketed as SIEM, which rely heavily on log files, correlation rules and human intervention to rule out false/positives, there is a new genre of products.&nbsp;As Gartner talks about it, we have entered the era of algorithms. Products like <a href="http://darktrace.com/">Darktrace</a>&nbsp;that make use of mathematical models can perform anomalous activity monitoring, without relying on signatures.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>8. Malware Protection</h2>
<p>The protection from malware these days is becoming wishful thinking or science fiction at best. With that being said, depending on how deep are you pockets you can make use of a class of services that provide <strong>File</strong> and <strong>URL Sandboxing </strong>for your mail services and even for your endpoints and servers. The volume of malware released daily does not make it possible for any vendor to produce virus/malware signatures in less than 24 hours.</p>
<p>Thus, going on the offensive security side is the only viable and realistic option. Some products I have used and have proven valuable in terms of getting malware analysed quite quickly have been <a href="https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/">Payload Security</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://csi.websense.com/">Websense CSI Threatscope</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.joesecurity.org/">Joe Security</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>9. Network Security</h2>
<p>It is trivial to mention that systems such as firewalls, IPS, IDS, proxy servers are still required and cannot be an optional component. The exponential growth of data and online activity makes it increasingly difficult for network engineers to keep ahead of malicious activity on the network and having these in place can deter or slow down attackers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>10. Information Risk Management Regime</h2>
<p>It is more important than ever before to have a baseline security risk management regime that is overarching all these interconnected components mentioned above.</p>
<p>These days, whether you are a one man shop or a large corporation, the fact that you can have an entire network stack setup on AWS is very attractive to cyber criminals.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>IT Security for Entrepreneurs</h2>
<p>The essential Cyber Security is not just for big corporations but for everyone that does business online. The fact that people can create an app these days that has a backend server handling personal data and be a one man shop, does not exclude them. Cyber criminals do not discriminate.</p>
<p>I will be writing another post on how this applies to startups and entrepreneurs having been involved with mobile app development and online businesses.</p>
