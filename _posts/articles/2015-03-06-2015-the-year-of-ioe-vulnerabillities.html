excerpt: IoEWith the emergence of more and more Linux powered devices, whether these
  are Android smart phones, Smart TVs, consumer level NAS drives, there has been a
  number of vulnerabilities that have surfaced in the last quarter of 2014 and even
  more so in 2015.Some of these exploits, have been there for over 20 years and this
  begs the question, why has it been revealed now.

<h2>IoE</h2>
<p>With the emergence of more and more Linux powered devices, whether these are Android smart phones, Smart TVs, consumer level NAS drives, there has been a number of vulnerabilities that have surfaced in the last quarter of 2014 and even more so in 2015.</p>
<p>Some of these exploits, have been there for over 20 years and this begs the question, why has it been revealed now.</p>
<p>A comprehensive security <a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/562005d9e4b053a5136bfb77/56200709e4b065725940b633/56200709e4b065725940b66a/1444939529258/rpt-vulnerabilities-under-attack.pdf">report</a>&nbsp;from Trend micro shows some trends that have started out in 2014 and will carry on and evolve further into 2015.</p>
<p>The simple premise is that anything connected to the Internet, is potentially exploitable and thus should be included in the scope of IT Security audits.</p>
<p>As we enter the era of IoT and IoE, there more at stake, in terms of both infrastructure and IP as business processes are being outsourced to SaaS and BPaaS.</p>
