<h2>The Information Age</h2>
<p>Nowadays everything is online. We are required to learn new systems and processes, in order to pay our taxes, find a job, socialise and entertain ourselves.</p>
<p>People that have been around more than 20-30 years have been brought up in a world without the internet. Most things were done by pen and paper and you would also have to show up to places to do everyday activities.</p>
<div>
<p> Like then, there were dangers and things to look out for and be wary. When you were out and about you knew through experience or instinct to protect yourself and your family.Even more today, we still have to deal with these everyday dangers of society, but even more with an entirely new world that runs through cables around the world and is called the internet.</p>
<div>
<p>The internet has redefined every industry out there and business is being conducted online. We are required to spend most of our daily hours staring at a screen, a pc, an iphone, an iPad.The generation gap lies between parents and kids that are being born into a computerised world, run online, where the first thing they interact with is a capacitive screen, before even they can spell or hold a pen. When I was younger my parents were knowledgeable enough to an extend to advise me, protect me and guide me, but when the internet came out, they didn't have a clue nor the time to learn about it.</p>
<div>There is far more criminal activity being conducted online these days, than offline and we need to know how to use technology and what is real and what isn't safe.</div>
</div>
<div>Microsoft created a guide for parents and teens on how to protect your identity online.</div>
