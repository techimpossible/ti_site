<h2>IoE</h2>
<p>With the emergence of more and more Linux powered devices, whether these are Android smart phones, Smart TVs, consumer level NAS drives, there has been a number of vulnerabilities that have surfaced in the last quarter of 2014 and even more so in 2015.</p>
<p>Some of these exploits, have been there for over 20 years and this begs the question, why has it been revealed now.</p>
<p>A comprehensive security <a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/562005d9e4b053a5136bfb77/56200709e4b065725940b633/56200709e4b065725940b66a/1444939529258/rpt-vulnerabilities-under-attack.pdf">report</a>&nbsp;from Trend micro shows some trends that have started out in 2014 and will carry on and evolve further into 2015.</p>
<p>The simple premise is that anything connected to the Internet, is potentially exploitable and thus should be included in the scope of IT Security audits.</p>
<p>As we enter the era of IoT and IoE, there more at stake, in terms of both infrastructure and IP as business processes are being outsourced to SaaS and BPaaS.</p>
