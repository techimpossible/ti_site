<p>This is a list of evidence that we have entered a new era.</p>
<h2>The Surveillance Era</h2>

</ol>
<p>The emergence of faster internet connection in most developed countries has allowed for even more transmission of data is a shorter amount of time.</p>
<p>This has led to the birth of terms like "big data".</p>
<p>As detailed in this <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6108496.stm">BBC article</a> and the research conducted by independent researchers at <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.surveillance-studies.net%2F%3Fpage_id%3D119&amp;ei=D6VDVbzoBcXLaMSpgdAH&amp;usg=AFQjCNErfNLSWSDixDcqHsKrPYEOh3Q-Xg&amp;sig2=1nusVmxCDoZzUEK8zDbkdA&amp;bvm=bv.92189499,d.d2s">Surveillance Studies Network</a> produced this <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/02_11_06_surveillance.pdf">report</a> in 2006 and it currently being updated.</p>
<p>As we are all creatures of habits we are not consciously aware at all times of patterns we follow, but somebody else is.</p>
<h2>Big data harvesting</h2>
<p>The post Edward Snowden world is quite confusing.</p>
<p>Every service we use collects data about us.</p>
<p>There is always a reason behind this.</p>
<p>To protect us.</p>
<p>To provide better services to us and make our lives easier and better.</p>
<p>The TV show "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1839578/">Person of Interest</a>" created by the Nolan brothers portray a scary resemblance with the current state of society.</p>
<p>In the show one of the key pieces of data that is being used to identify subjects is their social security number, which in the U.S. is linked to everything. This is already happening but with less obvious ways like the SSN.</p>
<p>I visited <a href="http://44con.com/">44CON</a> in London last week and was amazed at what you can do these days with just some bits of data. A company called <a href="https://www.digitalshadows.com/">Digital Shadows</a> can look at your digital shadow on the internet, social media, the dark web and interpret all these data into something meaningful.</p>
<p>It is quite amazing what Digital Shadows has managed to create. Given that the big vendors who have a long  list of systems like SIEM, Log Management, Threat management, proxies, firewalls and even Open Source Threat exchanges don't come even close with correlating data the way Digital Shadows does.</p>
<p>You can hear more about it on the London Real podcast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqTGtBtU2nU">episode</a> with Alastair Paterson, founder of Digital Shadows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Where is everything being kept?</h2>
<p>All the data that is being gathered by all the sources mentioned above ends up in Data Centres.</p>
<p>There are private Data Centres but most apps and services we use on a daily basis end up in one the DCs owned by the companies below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Amazon Web Services</li>
<li>Google Cloud</li>
<li>RackSpace</li>
<li>IBM</li>
<li>Microsoft Azure</li>
<li>Apple iCloud</li>
</ol>
<p>Governments like the US can access any of those Data Centres under the Patriot Act and poke around whether you like it or not. A disproportionate amount of the world's data is under US jurisdiction and not many people are aware of this when uploading something to Facebook or iCloud.</p>
<p>So, next time you access Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, Istagram, Dropbox remember that once something is out there it is out of your control.</p>
