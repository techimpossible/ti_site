<blockquote><p>Death is very likely the single best invention of Life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.</p>
<p>Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away on the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.</p>
<p>Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap do overthinking you have something to lose.</p>
<p>You are already naked.</p>
<p>The is no reason not to follow your heart.</p>
