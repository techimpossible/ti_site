<p>As I've been looking into various Security products, it has become more evident to me that the world is nothing like it was ten years ago and even a year ago.</p>
<p>Vendors are struggling to keep up with threats and vulnerabilities, gluing disparate products together and slapping new stickers on like <strong>SIEM.</strong></p>
<p>It doesn't take long to understand that no single product can deliver.</p>
<p>As with every aspect of IT Security, there is an element that no product can mitigate, and that is peoples' behaviors.</p>
<p>With all the Threat Exchange databases and underground feeds coming into a product, setting up your correlations rules is one part of the spectrum. User education is the other part and is an issue that most Security professionals don't take into account. It is often some awareness course once a year.</p>
<h3><strong>Security Education</strong></h3>
<p>One element of mitigating breaches is by educating your staff to identify social engineering attempts either electronic or physical.</p>
<p>Spear phishing is getting more sophisticated, and most Security teams spend most of their time putting out fires than proactively educating their staff.</p>
<p>Services such <a href="http://www.knowbe4.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KnowBe4</a> who work closely with Kevin Mitnick can help raise awareness and have your team develop ninja skills when it comes to spam.</p>
<h3>Outsourced Security</h3>
<p>The other element is pure logistics. As Gartner suggests, if you are looking to use SIEM products like <a href="https://www.logrhythm.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Logrhythm</a>, you would still need a team of minimum eight people working on shift rotation to make proper use of such systems.</p>
<p>However, in the recent years an increasing number or MSSPs (Managed Security Service Providers) have emerged to handle your Cybersecurity footprint.</p>
<p>These companies have full SOC teams that can manage incidents at any stage of the Kill Chain. However, sending your server logs through the wire somewhere else is a necessary evil, andÂ the implications are yet to be seen.</p>
<h3><strong>Hostile Environment</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, something that is quite fundamental and no one seems to be talking about it, apart from Logically Secure, is the hostile network.</p>
<p>Once a company has been breached, which is sooner than you think, it takes anything up to <strong>200</strong> days for them to take notice. In the meantime, you are operating in a hostile environment. The hacker sees everything you do.</p>
<p>At the point you realise that a breach has occurred, the hackers are there watching you every step.</p>
<p>That is when you need a separate network that doesn't touch the internet for your incident response team. <a href="http://www.logicallysecure.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Logically Secure </strong></a>are working in this space, and it is essential for the Security industry to be tuning in. A time where people can hack anything from a laptop, a pacemaker, a plane, your moving car or even your wireless kettle and blow up your house.</p>
