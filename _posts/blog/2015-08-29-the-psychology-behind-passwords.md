<p>It is becoming more and more evident that psychological triggers amount for the highest percentage of Cybersecurity risks than actual technical exploits.<br />
A paper on <em><a rel="attachment wp-att-298" href="/docs/password-sharing.pdf">Individual Differences in Cyber Security Behaviors: An Examination of Who Is Sharing Passwords</a> explains the psychology behind selecting a password and sharing passwords.</em></p>
<p>That just goes to show that passwords are inundated just like Antivirus software has been for a long time now.</p>
<p>The need for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication">2-factor authentication</a> is essential and most services have employed such mechanisms, but it sometimes requires some digging around to find.</p>
<p>Starting today look into enabling 2-step authentication for Gmail, Dropbox, Evernote and anything else your using.</p>
<p>It will save you lots of headaches.</p>
